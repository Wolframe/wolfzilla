  - how to solve the null project owner mapping problem to empty Owner in

    - empty default value should set an empty string in the widget

      of widgets forming the project form

    form? user.selected=main.id as assignment would be login, but where?!

  - use FTS3/4 for text search
  - find a better way of object tree construction
- qtClient
  - pass login/password to Wolframe

    with state handle and/or tree expansion mechanism
  - tree widget

  - activate a simplistic authenticator
  - make sure the login gets passed to the TDL, there we can use it
    in a SQL statement to set ownerID
